# SEDP Design Patterns Collection

This repository contains all the code I’ve written while learning various software design patterns in our **Software Engineering Design Patterns (SEDP)** course.

## 🔍 Overview

Here you will find implementations of several important design patterns, including:

- Singleton Pattern
- Decorator Pattern
- Strategy Pattern

Each pattern is implemented with simple and understandable code examples to demonstrate its core concept and usage.

##  Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A personal archive of what I've learned during the SEDP course.
- A reference for students and developers looking to understand and implement design patterns in real code.

Feel free to explore and use any part of this code for learning purposes.
